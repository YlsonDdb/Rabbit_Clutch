# Rabbit_Clutcher
Welcome to an easily assembled parallel gripper. It features a DM-4310-2EC 12V brushless planetary gear motor and a linear rail with two sliders for opening and closing. 

Each component has been designed to be 3D-printable with minimal support required, ensuring a smooth surface finish and reducing the need for post-print treatment. The gripper's head is swappable, offering greater flexibility for adapting to different use cases.
